# The Simulation of SIM Card Swap Attack and Phone Number Recycle Attack

---

## How to simulate?

To simulate the attacks, I creat a server-client struct to show the interaction between users and internet. Client shows the user with their identities, and the server in roles of mobile phone carriars and websites with phone authentication. Users can make phone calls through the sever.
